# DEC_Synoptic_weather
Implementation of VGG-16 autoencoder architecture and Deep Embedded Clustering algorithm for synoptic weather charts

This is my final year project for the field of Environmental Engineering. 

This implementation attempts to follow the work from "Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis" of Junyuan Xie, Ross Girshick, Ali Farhadi (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335).

For training models and clustering models please see "model.py", "model_DEC_train.py", "dec", and "utils.py". 

The project is submitted as a proof of concept.
